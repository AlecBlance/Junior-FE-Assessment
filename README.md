# Junior Front End Assessment

This is an assessment to measure my capability as a Front End Developer. This is a **48-hour** assessment which includes two Tasks.

## [Task 1](https://github.com/AlecBlance/Junior-FE-Assessment/tree/main/Task1)

has a set of instructions, and design to follow. I was given the creative freedom to showcase any product. It should also be responsive, and with good aesthetics.

## [Task 2](https://github.com/AlecBlance/Junior-FE-Assessment/tree/main/Task2)

a To-Do list which has all the basic functions such as add, delete, complete.

### Technologies used

- **React** - I used this Javascript library to easily create and manage UI components and states. It also supports other libraries which is a handy arsenal for building a Single Page Application
- **Tailwind** - This is a CSS library which has a set of predefined classes. I used this for simplicity, and responsiveness.
- **Vite** - A simple lightweight local development server which includes templates for React. It has Hot Module Replacement â€‹ which instantly shows UI updates without reloading the web page.
- **NPM** - A package manager I used for install libraries mentioned above.
